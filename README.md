# Python_ETL

ETL processes using a Tkinter GUI with Python:

(ETL = Extraction, Transformation and Load)
(GUI = graphical user-interface)

-   Extract:

    -   Delimited data (including or excluding headers)
    -   Positional data (including or excluding headers)
    -   Excel data (including or excluding headers)
    -   XML data (...not yet implemented in the GUI)
    -   JSON data (...not yet implemented in the GUI)

-   Transform (...not yet implemented in the GUI):

    -   Join data:
        -   Left join
        -   ... more will follow soon!
    -   Group data:
        -   ... more will follow soon!

-   Load:
    -   Delimited data
    -   Positional data
    -   Excel data
    -   XML data (...not yet implemented in the GUI)
    -   JSON data (...not yet implemented in the GUI)

GUI usage:

-   Most of the GUI
-   Header selection is separated by ";"
-   Position selection is separated by ";" and start with "0"

TODO:

-   Implement an append option
-   Implement XML and JSON extraction and loading (modification needed to the extract classes)
-   Implement transformation options
