# Python_ETL

ETL processes using a Tkinter GUI with Python:

(ETL = Extraction, Transformation and Load)
(GUI = graphical user-interface)

-   Extract:

    -   Delimited data (including or excluding headers)
    -   Positional data (including or excluding headers)
    -   Excel data (including or excluding headers)
    -   XML data
    -   JSON data

-   Transform (...not yet implemented in the GUI):

    -   Join data:
        -   Left join
        -   ... more will follow soon!
    -   Group data:
        -   ... more will follow soon!

-   Load:
    -   Delimited data
    -   Positional data
    -   Excel data
    -   XML data
    -   JSON data

GUI usage:

-   Most of the GUI is self explanatory
-   Header selection is separated by ";"
-   Position selection is separated by ";" (and starts with "0")

TODO:

-   Implement an append option
-   Implement transformation options
